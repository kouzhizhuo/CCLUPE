CCLUPE is a benchmark grounded in authentic consumer credit transaction logs, covering both personal and micro-enterprise (SME) clients. Unlike benchmarks limited to general financial knowledge or synthetic data, CCLUPE employs a hierarchical framework with 7 knowledge domains, 16 sub-domains, and 4 cognitive levels. To ensure practical relevance, the dataset and questioning logic were developed in consultation with professional credit underwriters. Their expertise ensures that each evaluation task mirrors the specific spend patterns, risk signals, and decision-making logic critical to real-world loan approvals. This expert-validated structure enables a systematic evaluation of LLMs' credit underwriting and reasoning capabilities in high-stakes financial scenarios.
